# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to determine what cryptocurreencies exist on the trading market and how they could be grouped to build a classification system for development of a new investment. Since there is no known output unsupervised machine learning is used. Furthermore, the data that we will be working with has to be processed before grouping the cryptocurrencies using the clustering algorithm. As a result of this, the following steps has to be performed for preparing the an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency markey:

- Preprocessing the Data for PCA.
- Reducing the Data for PCA.
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-means.
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results.
